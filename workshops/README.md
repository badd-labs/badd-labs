Call for Participation
---

Recent years witness the increasing adoption of blockchain technology and workforce shortage in the blockchain job market. BADD labs, designed and developed by Dr. Tang’s team at Syracuse University, is to bridge this gap. The primary learning objective is empowering students to create secure domain applications with blockchains (blockchain for security).

The BADD labs are designed based on real-world blockchain applications or attack scenarios relatable to students. For each lab module, we provide lab description/instructions, lectures introducing prerequisite knowledge, and solutions (only available to registered teachers with a plan to use the labs in their teaching). Students are expected to learn secure development skills on blockchain and smart contract, including security analysis, secure design and identify attacks.

BADD lab modules can be integrated into a variety of cyber-security and software-engineering courses at both graduate and undergraduate levels. We will work with instructors to customize and tailor the modules for different course settings and student background.

Training objectives
---

The two-day lab-training workshop, scheduled for May 3-4, 2024, will be virtual and publicly available. This workshop particularly targets at cyber-security educators from the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) community. The workshop is taught by Dr. Yuzhe Tang at Syracuse University and is organized by Dr. Hongmei Chi at Florida A&M University (FAMU).

During the workshop, Dr. Tang will introduce the prerequisite knowledge needed to complete the lab and provide guidance on the necessary configurations. In each lab session, Dr. Tang and his graduate students will conduct training sessions for the eight lab modules, each lasting approximately 45 to 50 minutes. Participants will gain insights into blockchain concepts and the purpose behind developing various lab topics through Dr. Tang's guidance and hands-on exercises. The overarching goal is to empower educators to deploy these labs in their home institutions following the workshop.
