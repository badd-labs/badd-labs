Lab B6: Zero-Knowledge Proofs and their Blockchain Applications 
===

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) is a useful cryptographic tool that can enable privacy-preserving and secure applications on blockchains. 
In a ZK-proof protocol, one party (the prover) proves to another party (the verifier) that a certain statement is true without revealing any information about the statement itself except for its validity. For instance, such a statement can be “Prover Alice knows a secret key SK that maps to a public key PK“. ZK-proof would convince the verifier that the prover Alice knows SK yet without disclosing SK itself to the verifier.

ZK-proof can be naturally integrated with a blockchain in domain applications. The figure above illustrates the common system model of a ZK-proof based blockchain application. A trusted third party (TTP) first generates a pair of keys: proving.key and verification.key. 
In Step 1, he sends proving.key to the Prover. 
In Step 2, he sends to the blockchain a smart contract `verifier.sol` that encodes the verification key.
In Step 3, the Prover generates the proof using proving.key. She sends the proof to the verifier by invoking `verifier.sol` with the proof.
In Step 4, the verification result, such as valid statement, is publicly observed by the domain application. If it is verified, the domain application can proceed and conduct the next step.

The ZK-proof based protocol can be used to safeguard a variety of blockchain applications, such as user authentication, preserving user privacy, etc.
In this lab, we will program a series of privacy-sensitive statements and run ZK-proof provided by zokrates .

Exercise 1: Hello-world ZK program and Setup
---

Install [[ZoKrates](https://zokrates.github.io/gettingstarted.html)] from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZoKrates/ZoKrates
cd ZoKrates
export ZOKRATES_STDLIB=$PWD/zokrates_stdlib/stdlib
cargo build -p zokrates_cli --release
cd target/release
```

Alternatively, if you are on MacOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -LSfs get.zokrat.es | sh
```

Create a file `root.zok` by copying the following content:

```
def main(private field X, field Y) {
    assert(X * X == Y);
    return;
}
```

Run the following commands in a terminal. Here, we consider three parties, Alice the prover, Bob the verifier on blockchain, Charlie the trusted party to set up the platform.

```bash
# Charlie performs the following:
# Step 1 & 2.
# compile
zokrates compile -i root.zok
# it generates a pair of keys: proving.key and verify.key in the current folder.
zokrates setup
# export a solidity verifier including verify.key
zokrates export-verifier
# deploy verifier.sol to blockchain (Bob), also sends proving.key to Alice


# Step 3.
# execute the program where 337 is X and 113569 is Y
zokrates compute-witness -a 337 113569
# generate a proof of computation (using proving.key)
zokrates generate-proof
# get proof.json from Alice, and embed proof.json in tx to be sent to blockchain.

# Step 4. Contract verifier.sol is invoked by Alice's transaction; the execution result indicates if the proof is verified.
```

After executing `zokrates export-verifier`, you will find a `verifier.sol` generated, deploy it to Remix IDE.

Inspect the `verifier.sol` file and send a transaction to verify the zokrates-generated proof in Remix.

- Hints 1: add ZoKrates to PATH as suggested 
    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/YOUR DIR/.zokrates/bin
    ```
- Hint 2: You can find `a`, `b`, `c`, and input values required for `verifier.verifyTx()` in generated `proof.json` file, which follows the format below:
    ```python
    proof: [[a[0],a[1]], [[b[0][0],b[0][1]],[b[1][0],b[1][1]]], [c[0],c[1]]]
    ```

Exercise 2. Prove Your Age 
---

Imagine an online liquor store selling wine and requiring proof of age from customers. Consider David, the liquor store, Alice, a customer, and Bob the blockchain. Alice generates zero-knowledge proof of her age verifiable on-chain. David observes the verification result from Bob on-chain and can proceed to sell the wine in Alice's cart.

Complete the following program to implement the ZK proof-of-age. Then, test and run your ZK program in the setup from Exercise 1.

```
def main(private field age, field min_age) {
    // implement your proof below
    return;
}
```

Exercise 3. Prove Your Knowledge of Hash Preimage 
---

A more common way of using ZK-proof is to prove the knowledge of a hash preimage. That is, given hash $y=H(x)$, Alice tries to prove to Bob that she knows the preimage $x$ under the hash digest $y$, without revealing $x$ to Bob.

Complete the following template program to implement the ZK-proof of knowledge of hash preimage.

```
import "hashes/sha256/512bitPacked" as sha256packed;

def main(private field a, private field b, private field c, private field d) -> field[2] {
    field[2] h = sha256packed([a, b, c, d]);
//implement your code below

    return h;
}
```

The first line imports the `sha256packed` function from the `ZoKrates` standard library.

- Hint: You can run the given program with the secret to find out the hash digest, and then use the digest to check.
