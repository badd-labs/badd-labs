BADD Labs in the News
---

- BADD-labs workshop for teachers in UBCU and other universities: [[Workshop website](workshops/README.md)].
    - We wrapped up our workshop with a wonderful group of attendees from 12 HBCU institutions with disciplines in CS/CE, i-school, and management: [[Group photo](workshops/badd-group-photo2.png)]
- The labs were used in "CIS/FIN629: Blockchain Foundations and Applications", a cross-listed course for graduate computer science students and finance students at Syracuse University (2018-2022) [[Course website](https://tristartom.github.io/teaching/22f-fin600/index.html)].
- Our labs are featured in blockchain education in ASEE 2022.
- Our labs are featured in the NSF blockchain-education workshop 2022.

BADD Labs in other Languages
---

We aim to bring BADD Labs to the International community and will translate it into different languages.

- Lab A1. Transaction exploration [[Chinese version](labs/A1/README-Zh.md)]

If you are willing to help translate BADD Labs to your language, contact us (tristartom@gmail.com).
